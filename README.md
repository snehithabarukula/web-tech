# Chipp-Arcade
In recent years, we can observe the rapid growth of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growing game development. This Project is an Online Gaming Website Where one can play multiple games. We implemented an Advanced Authentication System For Providing Better Authentication for user experience. Online gaming can refer to any type of game that a user can play through the Internet or through a computer network but most of the time, online gaming refers to video games played over the Internet, where multiple players are at different localities. The ChippArcade provides an easy interface that will enable users to surf through the website and play a game of their choice. It provides users with more pleasure and joy to their minds by playing these traditional arcade games such as snake game, pinball, pong, etc. A registered user can directly enter the website by login in using his/her username and password. Basically, the website contains three arcade games.
