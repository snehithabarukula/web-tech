## Introduction
In recent years, we can observe the rapid growth of software engineering and development and even more rapidly growing game development. This Project is an Online Gaming Website Where one can play multiple games. We implemented an Advanced Authentication System For Providing Better Authentication for user experience. Online gaming can refer to any type of game that a user can play through the Internet or through a computer network but most of the time, online gaming refers to video games played over the Internet, where multiple players are at different localities. The ChippArcade provides an easy interface that will enable users to surf through the website and play a game of their choice. It provides users with more pleasure and joy to their minds by playing these traditional arcade games such as snake game, pinball, pong, etc. A registered user can directly enter the website by login in using his/her username and password. Basically, the website contains three arcade games.

## Technologies Used
1) Front-end: Chipp Arcade is a web application that refers to the technology usually refers to the programming languages that are used to develop the platform for online gamers. Chipp Arcade is built using html,css,javascript.
2) Back-end : Database is the heart of the technology platform, where all of the main data related to the website are stored. The Primary database will collect the details from the userâ€™s and it's responsible for the data that are shown on UI (front-end). Chipp Arcade uses MySQL as database software for the back-end.

## System Requirements 
MySQL web applications can be run on almost any machine :Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix, Solaris, to name just a few. Almost any computer should have the necessary performance to run Django during development.

- FOR WINDOWS- Windows 7 version OS, 800MHz Intel Pentium III or equivalent processor, 512MB memory and an additional 250 MB of free disk space.
- FOR UBUNTU- 9.10 version, 800MHz Intel Pentium III or equivalent processor, 512 MB memory and an additional 150 MB of free disk space.
- FOR MAC OS- 10.7 Intel version, Dual-Core Intel processor, 512 memory and additional 150 MB of free disk space. Latest version of python. Python 2.7 cannot be used with the current releases of Django (The Django 1.11.x series is the last to support Python 2.7).
